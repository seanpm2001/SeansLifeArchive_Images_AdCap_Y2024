## Overview

<details open><summary><p><b>[Click/tap here to expand/collapse the overview section]</b></p></summary>

<!--
I played AdCap again this week. I spent more time playing this week, and made some progress. I eventually wrapped up and quit when I was finally able to find a stopping point. I had a really good time playing this week. - 2023, Saturday, July 8th

I skipped my AdVenture Capitalist session this week, as I didn't have the time or motivation to play today. - 2023, Saturday, July 15th to 2023, Saturday, August 5th

I had a short AdVenture Capitalist session today, as I was running low on battery. I made minor progress, then played for a short amount of time in the event, before I wrapped up and quit. - 2023, Saturday, November 11th

I had a longer length session today, playing the event for a long time. I also had a good time playing. - 2024, Saturday, February 24th

-->

- My weekly session was skipped today, as I am trying to get control of my sleep schedule, and I was far behind on my personal journal. I cut gameplay to make time for other projects. - 2024, Saturday, March 2nd

</details>

<!-- Notes !-->

<!-- 2023.04.15
Excessively long time played, split across several sessions
Using lots of time warps, sunk cost fallacy on the event
Playing across a time period over 4 hours in length
Event was most played. It was likely the best I have ever done in any event.
!-->

<!-- 2023.04.22
AdCap no updates
Long session, excessive
Spent some time on Earth and Mars, moon received the least attention
The boost on Mars is infinite, you can keep tapping it to make it go on longer
Decided to let it run out, so I could finish up and go to the event
Very long event gameplay
Game closed and reopened, so I could get an ad boost in the event
1% land event, 76% connections
Finally quit
!-->

<!-- 2023.04.29
AdCap 2023.04.29

Very long session
Event gameplay Capitalist Cakeday
Ended much earlier
Taking a break to eat and enjoy the car ride
Came back to find that I was in a dead spot, and my offline earnings did not keep up
Helped me end my addiction and quit earlier
Unable to upload media today, not enough time, and the Internet was too slow. I will give myself until Tuesday.
!-->

<!-- 2023.05.06
Ad crashes 2x
The second crash was because I was trying to see if it was just a 1 time thing
Poor progress in the event

- I became significantly addicted, and made lots of progress on the Capitalist Cakeday event. I had a long trip home, so playing this was what I did. It is the most difficult event in the game, and I made it further than I ever have before. My Internet cut out once for nearly an hour, as the device running the mobile hotspot died, yet the game still resumed, and didn't interrupt when reconnecting. I will find out (hopefully) next week if I lost progress or not. - 2023, Saturday, March 11th
- I played the Capitalist Cakeday event for a while today during my trip to Cannon Beach. I did not expect the event to repeat so early. Later on, I took a break to eat and enjoy the car ride. At some point during this time, I enteed a deadspot, and my offline earnings did not keep up. This helped with my addiction, and I quit much earlier. - 2023, Saturday, April 29th
- I played the Capitalist Cakeday event for a while today, but it was too slow to progress, so I eventually quit. - 2023, Saturday, June 10th
- I played the Capitalist Cakeday event for a very long time today, and made a lot of progress, but had to quit, as I used up all of my leisure time for this block of the day. - 2023, Saturday, October 14th
- I played the Capitalist Cakeday event for a short time today, and made a small amount of progress, but had to quit, as my battery was low. - 2023, Saturday, December 9th

</details>

- I played the Cashalot event for a very long time today, and made a large amount of progress. It felt like the best I had ever done in this event, but I feel there might have been a better attempt in the past. I eventually quit when I ran too low on battery. - 2023, Saturday, October 21st
- I played the Cashalot event for a short amount of time, but rapidly made significant progress, even though I just wanted to go to the second reward and quit. I eventually quit when I finished the hard drive backup I was doing during the session. - 2023, Saturday, October 21st
- I played the Cashalot event for a very short amount of time, but made some progress. I forced myself to quit extra early, as I had things I needed to do today, and couldn't spend any more time on gameplay. - 2023, Saturday, December 16th

</details>

- I played the Cashalot event for a Llong amount of time, and made some progress. I received the first 6 rewards, and played a little more. I was very disappointed in this event today. Last week, it was said that the `For the love of money` (Valentines day) event was going to be active. Either it was cut short, or they reversed course. I was wanting to play that event this week, but I had to refocus my excitement to this event, which I didn't have as good of a time with. I forced myself to quit when I ran low on battery, and also because I had other things to do today, and I couldn't spend any more time on gameplay. - 2024, Saturday, February 17th

- I played the Saturday Morning Fever event for a very long time, splitting across several sessions over a 4+ hour period. I used lots of time warps, it became a sunk cost fallacy for me continuing to play the event, and unlock something.

- I played the 1% land event for a very long time, although still staying within the same session. I didn't waste any of my time warps this time. Early on, I closed and reopened the game, so that I could enable the ad boost. I now have 76% of the capitalist connections for this event. I eventually wrapped up and quit. - 2023, Saturday, April 22nd
- I played the 1% land event for a short amount time in comparison to last week. I didn't waste any of my time warps this time. I eventually wrapped up and quit. - 2023, Saturday, June 3rd
- I played the 1% land event for an excessive amount of time in comparison to last time. I wasted a few time warps, and made notable progress, before I eventually wrapped up and quit when my battery hit 5% and I lost a couple hours of time. - 2023, Saturday, October 7th
- I played the 1% land event for an excessive amount of time in comparison to last time. I wasted a single time warp, and made notable progress, before I eventually wrapped up and quit when I ran too low on time. - 2023, Saturday, December 2nd

- I played the 1% land event for an excessive amount of time in comparison to last time. I accidentally used a single time warp, and made significant progress, before I eventually wrapped up and quit when I ran too low on time. I split into 3 parts, as my battery went too low 3 separate times. I feel I will rank high in the event, and that this was my best performance out of any event in this game. I unlocked the first 6 rewards, and stocked up over 13000 event points. - 2024, Saturday, January 27th

- I played the `Merry Merger` event extensively today, using a single time warp, and making significant progress, before I eventually wrapped up and quit when I finally stopped procrastinating. The game was using political innuendos, and it was concerning to me. Also, the word "Millennial" was spelled incorrectly (there are 2 n's, not one, "Millenial" is an incorrect spelling) I also don't see how I will get 40 xmas badges, when this event happens once a year. I played extra so that I get some extra rewards, including an event booster, and 3 connections. - 2023, Saturday, December 23rd

# Notice - Didn't play

I skipped my AdCap session today to save time, as I didn't feel like like playing this week. I might play again next week. It isn't that likely though.

I plan to return eventually to finish some parts of the game, then I will permanently wrap up. I am currently considering switching the day of gameplay to Monday.

## 2022, Saturday, March 5th

This week, I strongly considered swapping my AdCom session for an AdCap session, due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, but decided against it. Even then, I considered doubling up the sessions, but since my AdCom session went on for far too long, I didn't have the time for it. Hope for returning to this game definitely isn't dead.

## 2022, Saturday, June 11th

Due to a massive resource waste in AdVenture Communist today, I considered playing AdCap to fill in the time. I ended up playing much longer than expected, and was unable to get to AdCap today. - 2022, Saturday, June 4th to 2022, Saturday, June 11th

### HyperHippo ad controversy (2022 March 26th - 2022 July 16th)

The parent company for AdVenture Communist and AdVenture Capitalist (and also AdVenture Ages, and Vacation Tycoon (newly released) which I don't play) is having an ongoing controversy regarding suppressing community criticism regarding increasing montization of their games. It currently looks like the company is going to run itself out of business over greed, so my gameplay of the 2 games is now on life support. I hope to continue on for as long as I can, but be prepared that the cord may be cut any day now. Unfortunately, these are online only games that don't have offline play support, so when HyperHippo dies, I can no longer play.

It is looking like they are going to survive this controversy, but I can't be sure. - 2022 March 26th to 2022 July 16th.
