# 2024, Monday, January 8th - Didn't play

I didn't play AdVenture Capitalist today. Today was not a scheduled day to play.

## Why?

Due to a discovery on Saturday, 2020 October 24th about how much time all games together take up, and how little time it leaves me, I had to make a schedule change for gaming, splitting all 25 games I play across a 7 day period, instead of all in 1 day.

## When will you come back?

I won't be playing this game again until the next time slot, which is Saturday. I might play again on 2024, Saturday, January 13th.
